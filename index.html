<p>TheGardenShop.ie was set up with the aim of filling a massive gap in the garden supplies & tools market. To date, there are no other discount online garden centres where the public can go and get all their gardening equipment at massively discounted prices. There has been, to date a sort of unwritten rule on pricing and this is what TheGardenShop.ie aims to break. By this, we hope to give the whole gardening market in Ireland a huge & badly needed shake up.</p>
